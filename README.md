# terraform-aws-budget [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/JamesWoolfenden/terraform-aws-budget.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/JamesWoolfenden/terraform-aws-budget) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/JamesWoolfenden/terraform-aws-budget.svg)](https://github.com/JamesWoolfenden/terraform-aws-budget/releases/latest)

Terraform module - creates a Budget and a Budget for half as much.

---

It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).

## Usage

These are just basic examples, your budget rules should be much more sophisticated.

Include this repository as a module in your existing terraform code:

```terraform
module "budget" {
  source            = "JamesWoolfenden/budget/aws"
  version           = "0.3.32"
  limit             = var.limit
  time_period_start = var.time_period_start
  budget            = var.budget
  notification      = var.notification
}
```

The module reference uses 2 objects, budget and notification, from the example data. This module implements billing alerts on your AWS account,
the provided variables are in **examplea.auto.tfvars**:

```HCL
budget={
    name              = "budget-ec2-monthly"
    budget_type       = "COST"
    time_unit         = "MONTHLY"
    limit_unit        = "Pounds"
   }
notification={
    comparison_operator        = "GREATER_THAN"
    threshold                  = 100
    threshold_type             = "PERCENTAGE"
    notification_type          = "FORECASTED"
    subscriber_email_addresses = ["test@example.com"]
  }
```

The variable limit creates 2 sets of alerts one at its setting and another at half.
Additional users or groups can added to *subscriber_email_addresses*.
